        <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
        <p>
            When you visit our site, sign up for our service, or browse our marketing resources, we may collect information that you
            voluntarily provide, such as your name, email address, clinic details, and payment information. We also collect
            technical data via cookies and analytics tools to understand how visitors use our website.
        </p>
        <h2>How We Use Information</h2>
        <p>
            We use the information you provide to deliver our services, process payments, communicate with you, and improve our
            offerings. We do not sell your personal data to third parties. Patient leads generated through our service are sent
            directly to your clinic and are not stored by us.
        </p>
        <h2>Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            We implement standard security measures to protect your information. However, no method of transmission over the
            internet is 100% secure. By using our service, you acknowledge this risk.
        </p>
        <h2>Third‑Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            We may use trusted third‑party partners to process payments (e.g., PayPal) and to deliver marketing services. These
            partners have their own privacy policies and terms.
        </p>
        <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We reserve the right to update this privacy policy at any time. We will notify you of significant changes by
            updating the date at the top of this page.

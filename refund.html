        <h2>No Refunds</h2>
        <p>
            Due to the nature of digital marketing services, all payments to LuxMedPro are non‑refundable. Once you
            subscribe, our team and partners immediately begin work on your account and commit advertising budgets and
            resources on your behalf.
        </p>
        <h2>Performance Guarantee</h2>
        <p>
            We stand by our service. If we do not deliver the guaranteed number of patient leads within a given month, we
            will continue working at no additional charge until your lead quota is met. This guarantee serves as your assurance
            that we are invested in your success and limits the risk associated with your investment.

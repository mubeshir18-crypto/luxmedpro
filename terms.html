        <h1>Terms & Conditions</h1>
        <p>These terms govern your use of the LuxMedPro service.</p>
    </section>

    <section class="process" style="max-width:800px;">
        <h2>Service Description</h2>
        <p>
            LuxMedPro provides done‑for‑you patient acquisition services for cosmetic clinics and med spas. When you
            subscribe to our service, we run advertising campaigns on your behalf to generate leads and send them directly to
            you. We do not provide medical services and are not responsible for your communications or agreements with
            the patients we refer.
        </p>
        <h2>Payment & Fees</h2>
        <p>
            By subscribing to LuxMedPro you agree to pay a recurring monthly fee of $5,000 USD. This payment
            will automatically renew every month until you cancel. We reserve the right to change pricing for new subscribers at
            any time. Existing subscribers will be notified in advance of any change to their monthly fee.
        </p>
        <h2>Guarantee</h2>
        <p>
            We guarantee a minimum number of qualified patient leads per month. If we fail to deliver the promised number of
            leads, we will continue working without charge until the agreed target is met. All other payments are non‑refundable.
        </p>
        <h2>White‑Label Fulfilment</h2>
        <p>
            We may subcontract marketing and advertising services to trusted third‑party partners. These partners act solely as
            fulfilment providers and are bound by agreements to deliver services as described. You acknowledge and agree
            that LuxMedPro’s responsibility is limited to the coordination of these services.
        </p>
        <h2>Limitation of Liability</h2>
        <p>
            To the maximum extent permitted by law, LuxMedPro shall not be liable for any indirect, incidental, special or
            consequential damages arising out of or relating to your use of the service. Our total liability for any claim
            arising from your use of the service shall not exceed the amount paid by you to us in the three months preceding
            the claim.
        </p>
        <h2>Governing Law</h2>
        <p>
            These terms are governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of the jurisdiction in which LuxMedPro
            operates. By using our service, you consent to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts in that jurisdiction.
